# NPM Modules

Initialise a node project to create a `package.json` file:

```js
npm init
```

Once the first package is added to the project and a `node_modules` folder is created, create a `.gitignore` file, add the `node_modules` folder.
This will prevent the `node_modules` folder from being added to any code pushes. These dependencies are added to the `package.json` file though so can be installed via `npm i`.
